# Frontend Mentor - Notifications page solution

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
